title: DBMax Events. Web design, WordPress website project
---

DB Max Events had an existing website which was not meeting their expectations. Delivering content to their current audience was not utilised. They wanted a new web design creating to promote the many sporting events they hold each year. However, they also wished to highlight other services they provide for race organisers. DB Max Events hold many races in the Gloucester area. Introduced to Transition Graphics by a former client who is also a sports event organiser. We delivered a WordPress website which allows easy organisation of their sports events. Plus we provide ongoing website support.
