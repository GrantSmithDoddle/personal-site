title: Loma Consulting. Branding, Logo design and Website Design
---

Loma Consulting approached Transition Graphics in the early stages of their business development. As a result, we were tasked with branding the new company with the goal of appealing to their niche market. In addition, we set about creating a website design which was fit for purpose and allows Louise to update her site regularly.

Loma Consulting help organisations maximise the effectiveness of their product management function through pragmatic consultancy, tailored training and targeted recruitment.
