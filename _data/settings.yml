  quote: '<p><strong>I used Grant at Transition Graphics</strong> for the design, development and ongoing maintenance of my business website this year. I have found them to be very professional, always very punctual and provide great value for money. I’ll be the first person to admit that I’m not graphically talented, or any good at all at what works and what doesn’t, and Grant took the time to explain how different elements of the site work and created all the graphical content himself in a format that’s both complex, but understandable. Our website now has a modern feel and a slick operation, and it’s helped our business engage with a more professional audience. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Transition Graphics for any other projects.</p>',
